# QUBS Climate Data API

A web API for accessing live data from the Queen's University Biological Station Climate Data network. The data
retrieved from this API is provided **completely as-is**. It should be made known that there is no quality assurance
or proofreading done to data stored hear and thus readings may be inaccurate.

## Requirements and Technologies

Requirements are listed programmatically in the `requirements.txt` file. The API is built on the
[Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for
a database.

## Accessing Data

The API is hosted at [http://climate.qubs.ca/api/](http://climate.qubs.ca/api/). Listed below are request paths based
on this URL for fetching data programmatically.

### `GET /messages/`

Lists all messages from the past 7 days sent from the stations.

#### Parameters

TODO

#### Example Request

TODO

### `GET /messages/[id]/` (where `[id]` is the numeric id of a message)

Shows a single message object.

#### Fields

`id`: A unique numerical ID representing the message.

`created`: A timestamp when the message was created (not when it arrived, but when it was added to the database).

`updated`: A timestamp of when the message in the database was last changed.

`goes_id`: The GOES self-timed identifier / address, unique to a station. Made up of 4 2-hexadecimal digit numbers.

`goes_channel`:

`goes_spacecraft`: Which GOES satellite was used to transmit the message. Possible values are `E` for east and `W` for
west. All QUBS climate stations communicate with the `E`ast satellite.

`arrival_time`: The time of arrival of the message to the ground station.

`failure_code`: Indicates a possible issue with the message or an error generated by the NOAA's Data Collection System
(DCS) Data Auto-Processing System (DAPS). Possible values are listed
[here](http://eddn.usgs.gov/dcpformat.html#failure).

`signal_strength`: A 2-digit number indicating the signal strength
([EIRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_isotropically_radiated_power)) with an assumption that the pilot is a
+47 dBm reference.

`frequency_offset`: Indicating if the Data Collection Platform is transmititng above or below the centre channel
frequency. The first character will always be a `+` or `-`, and the second character can be `0` through `9` or an `A`.
Offset can be calculated by multiplying the value by 50 Hz. If the second character is `A`, the frequency offset is
`+` or `-` `500`.

`modulation_index`: Can be one of 3 values: `N`ormal, `L`ow, or `H`igh.

`data_quality`: Can be one of 3 values: `N`ormal, `F`air, or `P`oor.

`data_source`: A 2-character code indicating a receiving location. A lookup table can be found
[here](http://eddn.usgs.gov/dataSourceCodes.html).

`recorded_message_length`: The length of the message excluding all above metadata.

`values`: An **ordered** list of values, which are measurements taken by the station (before decimal point insertion).

`message_text`: The transmitted message in its original form.

`station`: The API ID of the station which transmitted the message.

`data_id`: A generalized human- and machine-readable ID for displaying at the top of generated spreadsheets, etc.

`decimals`: How many decimal places a reading from the sensor has (as the climate stations only transmit whole numbers).

```json
{
    "id": 1,

```

#### Fields

`id`: A unique numerical ID representing the station.

`created`: A timestamp when the station was created (not when it was installed, but when the data object was added to
the database).

`updated`: A timestamp of when the data object representing the station in the database was last changed.

`name`: A human-readable name for the station.

`goes_id`: The GOES self-timed identifier / address, unique to the station. Made up of 4 2-hexadecimal digit numbers.

`sensors`: An **unordered** list of links to data object representations of the sensors on the station.
