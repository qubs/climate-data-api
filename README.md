# QUBS Climate Data API

A web API for accessing live data from the Queen's University Biological Station Climate Data network. The data
retrieved from this API is provided **completely as-is**. It should be made known that there is no quality assurance
or proofreading done to data stored hear and thus readings may be inaccurate.

## Requirements and Technologies

Requirements are listed programmatically in the `requirements.txt` file. The API is built on the
[Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for
a database.
