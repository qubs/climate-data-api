# QUBS Climate Data

A subsection of the QUBS API for accessing live data from the Queen's University Biological Station Climate Data
network. The data retrieved from this API is provided **completely as-is**. It should be made known that there is no
quality assurance or proofreading done to data stored hear and thus readings may be inaccurate.

    "values": [],
    "message_text": "...",
    "station": 8
}
```

(Message and values removed for conciseness)

#### Fields

`id`: A unique numerical ID representing the message.

`created`: A timestamp when the message was created (not when it arrived, but when it was added to the database).

`updated`: A timestamp of when the message in the database was last changed.

`goes_id`: The GOES self-timed identifier / address, unique to a station. Made up of 4 2-hexadecimal digit numbers.

`goes_channel`: A number representing the satellite transmit frequency.

`goes_spacecraft`: Which GOES satellite was used to transmit the message. Possible values are `E` for east and `W` for
west. All QUBS climate stations communicate with the `E`ast satellite.

`arrival_time`: The time of arrival of the message to the ground station.

`failure_code`: Indicates a possible issue with the message or an error generated by the NOAA's Data Collection System
(DCS) Data Auto-Processing System (DAPS). Possible values are listed
[here](http://eddn.usgs.gov/dcpformat.html#failure).

`signal_strength`: A 2-digit number indicating the signal strength
([EIRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_isotropically_radiated_power)) with an assumption that the pilot is a
+47 dBm reference.

`frequency_offset`: Indicating if the Data Collection Platform is transmititng above or below the centre channel
frequency. The first character will always be a `+` or `-`, and the second character can be `0` through `9` or an `A`.
Offset can be calculated by multiplying the value by 50 Hz. If the second character is `A`, the frequency offset is
`+` or `-` `500`.

`modulation_index`: Can be one of 3 values: `N`ormal, `L`ow, or `H`igh.

`data_quality`: Can be one of 3 values: `N`ormal, `F`air, or `P`oor.

`data_source`: A 2-character code indicating a receiving location. A lookup table can be found
[here](http://eddn.usgs.gov/dataSourceCodes.html).

`recorded_message_length`: The length of the message excluding all above metadata.

`values`: An **ordered** list of values, which are measurements taken by the station (before decimal point insertion).

`message_text`: The transmitted message in its original form.

`station`: The API ID of the station which transmitted the message.

### Reading

#### Format

{
    "id": 187337,
    "created": "2016-08-23T01:59:48.078269Z",

    "qc_processed": false,
    "invalid": false,
    "sensor": 1,
    "station": 1,
    "message": 4132
}
```

#### Fields

`id`: A unique numerical ID representing the reading.

`created`: A timestamp when the reading was created (not when it was taken, but when the data object was added to the
database).

`updated`: A timestamp of when the data object representing the reading in the database was last changed.

`read_time`: When the reading was taken (in UTC time).

`data_source`: Where the reading is sourced from. `G` means the value was downloaded from the **G**OES satellite, and
`L` means it was taken from the device data **L**og.

`value`: The value of the reading, raw from the message. Takes on a `null` value if the reading could not be parsed or
was deemed completely invalid by the auto-downloader. Does not include a decimal point (which can be located in the
details of the reading's sensor).

`qc_processed`: Whether or not a quality control system has processed and made a decision about the validity of this
reading.

`invalid`: Whether or not this point is invalid desplite posessing a non-`null` `value`.

`sensor`: The API ID of the sensor which took the reading.

`station`: The API ID of the station which transmitted the message and is linked with the aforementioned sensor.

`message`: The API Id of the GOES message which this reading was sourced from, if applicable.

### Sensor

#### Format

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "created": "2016-08-15T14:57:16.130683Z",

    "name": "lufft_ws_502umb_temp",
    "data_id": "air_temp",
    "decimals": 2
}
```

#### Fields

`id`: A unique numerical ID representing the sensor.

`created`: A timestamp when the sensor was created (not when it was installed, but when the data object was added to the
database).

`updated`: A timestamp of when the data object representing the sensor in the database was last changed.

`name`: A human- and machine-readable name representing the sensor. Preferably underscore-separated and all lowercase.

`data_id`: A generalized human- and machine-readable ID for displaying at the top of generated spreadsheets, etc.

`decimals`: How many decimal places a reading from the sensor has (as the climate stations only transmit whole numbers).

### Station

`name`: A human-readable name for the station.

`goes_id`: The GOES self-timed identifier / address, unique to the station. Made up of 4 2-hexadecimal digit numbers.

`sensors`: An **unordered** list of links to data object representations of the sensors on the station.
